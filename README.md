What is GraPHPizer?
-------------------

GraPHPizer uses graph technologies to offer a source code analytics engine for PHP projects. This includes nifty
graph visualizations like the following one:

Features include:

- Graph visualisations (~~completely useless~~ marginally useful, but they look pretty)
- Search your code base using the graph query language *Cypher*
- Automatic generation of UML diagrams from PHP code
- Type inference
